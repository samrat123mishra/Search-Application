		<p>JavaScript is also used in environments that are not Web-based,
			 such as PDF documents, site-specific browsers, and desktop widgets.
			 Newer and faster JavaScript virtual machines (VMs) and platforms built upon
			 them have also increased the popularity of JavaScript for server-side Web
			 applications. On the client side, developers have traditionally implemented
			 JavaScript as an interpreted language, but more recent browsers perform
			 just-in-time compilation. Programmers also use JavaScript in video-game development,
			 in crafting desktop and mobile applications, and in server-side network
			  programming with run-time environments such as Node.js.
