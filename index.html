            <p>This expression looks very cryptic because it is composed entirely of special characters, but it is much simpler than it first appears. The caret symbol, "^" matches the beginning of the text and the dollar sign "$" matches the end of the line. Using these special characters means the rest of the pattern must match the entire line of text verbatim, i.e. from the beginning to the end. The rest of the pattern is composed of two elements, the "\s" special character and the asterisk "*" special character. The "\s" matches any white space. White space is anything you can't actually see but has an effect on the text, such as spaces, tabs, and new lines. The "*" symbol means match zero or more occurrences of the preceding thing. So this pattern matches either nothing (an empty string) or a string of blanks.</p></div>
